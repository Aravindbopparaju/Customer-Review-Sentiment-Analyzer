Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.
